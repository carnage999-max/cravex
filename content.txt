SECTION: THE PROBLEM (Problem-first narrative)
Title: When cravings and stress take over, it rarely feels logical.
Body:
Cravings, anxiety, and stress often show up as patterns—not decisions. They can override intention, disrupt sleep, and pull attention into loops that feel difficult to interrupt.
CRAVEX® focuses on the nervous system layer of the experience: what happens before choice.

SECTION: HOW CRAVEX WORKS (Pattern interruption)
Title: Pattern interruption, designed to feel safe.
Body:
CRAVEX® is built around a simple idea: when the nervous system escalates, the fastest path back is often a structured interruption that is calm, guided, and repeatable.
The experience is designed to:
- reduce overwhelm
- restore moment-to-moment stability
- support follow-through without pressure

Callout (must remain gentle):
CRAVEX® is not built on fear or urgency. It is built on calm design and clear steps.

SECTION: TECHNOLOGY DEEP DIVE (Nervous system)
Title: A nervous-system lens (without the jargon)
Body:
CRAVEX® explains cravings and stress as signals moving through a system—trigger, escalation, and response.
The goal is to help users recognize the pattern early and introduce a safe interruption.
