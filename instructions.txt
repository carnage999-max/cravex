CRAVEX® WEBSITE — NON-NEGOTIABLE INSTRUCTIONS

1) SITE TYPE
- Single-page website in Next.js (App Router).
- All sections on / with anchor navigation.
- Optional guided walkthrough mode (user-controlled).

2) UX PHILOSOPHY
- Calm, grounded, non-triggering UI.
- NO flashing, NO countdowns, NO scarcity language, NO “act now”, NO manipulative popups.
- Trust > excitement. Education before conversion.
- Minimalist but premium.

3) DESIGN REQUIREMENTS
- Modern + futuristic aesthetic, but calming:
  - soft gradients, glass-like cards, thin borders
  - generous whitespace, readable typography
  - avoid harsh neon, avoid red alarm colors, avoid aggressive contrast patterns
- Animations:
  - Subtle only.
  - Must fully respect prefers-reduced-motion.
  - Add a “Reduce Motion” toggle in UI and persist preference.

4) THREE.JS HERO
- Use @react-three/fiber + drei.
- Visual: calming abstract shapes (e.g., slow-moving blobs, ribbons, particles) representing “signal → calm”.
- No intense motion, no rapid camera moves, no flashing.
- Provide fallback static hero if WebGL unavailable or reduce-motion enabled.

5) INTERACTIVE DIAGRAMS
- Use accessible SVG/Canvas components for:
  - Nervous system diagram labels (Trigger, Escalation, Loop, Interruption, Recovery)
  - Pattern interruption flow visuals
- Must be keyboard navigable and screen-reader friendly.
- Default state must be simple; user opts into deeper detail.

6) ACCESSIBILITY (REQUIRED)
- Semantic HTML, ARIA only when needed.
- Color contrast pass.
- Focus states visible.
- All interactive elements: keyboard accessible.
- Headings in proper order.
- Motion reduction respected everywhere.

7) CONTENT & CLAIMS
- Do NOT add medical claims.
- Do NOT claim cures or guaranteed outcomes.
- Keep tone calm, precise, and responsible.
- You may lightly edit wording for clarity, but do not introduce hype, fear, or urgency.

8) BACKEND (INSIDE NEXT.JS)
- Implement /api/contact route handler:
  - Validate with zod: name, email, message (required)
  - Send email via Resend
  - Env vars:
    - RESEND_API_KEY
    - CONTACT_TO_EMAIL
    - CONTACT_FROM_EMAIL
  - Return JSON success/error
  - Basic rate limiting (simple in-memory acceptable for MVP)
- No external backend service.

9) PRIVACY-FIRST ANALYTICS
- Do not install invasive trackers.
- If analytics exist, prefer minimal server-side event logs with no PII.
- Add a “Privacy & Safety” section explaining approach (from content.txt).

10) ENGINEERING QUALITY
- TypeScript strict.
- No console errors.
- Components split by section.
- Reusable UI primitives (Button, Card, Accordion).
- Performance-minded:
  - dynamic import heavy 3D components
  - images optimized
  - avoid unnecessary JS
- Add SEO:
  - metadata, OpenGraph, Twitter cards
  - basic JSON-LD (Organization + WebSite)

11) OUTPUTS REQUIRED
- Full Next.js project code.
- README with:
  - setup, env vars, dev scripts
  - deployment notes (AWS-friendly)
  - accessibility + motion notes
